# About
I am currently working as _post-doctoral research fellow_ at [INRIA Bordeaux - Sud-Ouest](https://www.inria.fr/en/centre-bordeaux-sud-ouest){:target="_blank"} in the team [Cardamom](https://team.inria.fr/cardamom){:target="_blank"}. Soon to be temporarily found in the [SED](http://sed.bordeaux.inria.fr){:target="_blank"} team as a _research engineer_ for the [Mmg platform](https://www.mmgtools.org){:target="_blank"}.

I am a full-time developer and maintainer of the [ParMmg](https://github.com/MmgTools/ParMmg){:target="_blank"} library and application for parallel mesh adaptation, supported by the European project [ExaQUte](http://exaqute.eu){:target="_blank"}.

My current interests concern the development of robust and open source software tools for academic research and engineering applications in the field of computational mechanics.
