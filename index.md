# About

Welcome to my personal webpage!

I am currently a research engineer in the [CARDAMOM](https://team.inria.fr/cardamom/) team at [INRIA Bordeaux - Sud-Ouest](https://www.inria.fr/en/centre-bordeaux-sud-ouest){:target="_blank"}.
Just before, you could have met me as _ad interim_ responsible for the development of the open source [Mmg platform](https://www.mmgtools.org){:target="_blank"} for simplicial remeshing in the [SED](http://sed.bordeaux.inria.fr){:target="_blank"} team.

My research interests focus on computational mechanics, more specifically on mesh adaptation for compressible flows and structural mechanics, with an inclination towards open source implementations.
I am a maintainer of the [ParMmg](https://github.com/MmgTools/ParMmg){:target="_blank"} library and application for parallel mesh adaptation, supported by the European research project [ExaQUte](http://exaqute.eu){:target="_blank"}, and also involved in the EuroHPC project [MICROCARD](https://microcard.eu/index-en.html){:target="_blank"}.
