# Current activities
## Development of the parallel mesh adaptation library [ParMmg](https://github.com/MmgTools/ParMmg){:target="_blank"}
Open source library for parallel mesh adaptation on top of the [Mmg3d](https://github.com/MmgTools/Mmg){:target="_blank"} remesher.

Written in C with MPI, version-controlled with git and tested with Jenkins. Designed to meet the academic and industrial needs of the [Mmg platform](https://www.mmgtools.org){:target="_blank"} and the [ExaQUte](http://exaqute.eu){:target="_blank"} European research project.

Details on the algorithm can be found in the document:
- [Parallel unstructured mesh adaptation using iterative remeshing and repartitioning](https://hal.inria.fr/hal-02386837/document){:target="_blank"}

## Development of the constant-connectivity mesh adaptation library _Fmg_
Library to perform constant-connectivity mesh adaptation in two and three dimensions for fluid mechanics simulations with moving fronts (like shock waves, free surface waves) for research applications.

# Past activities

## Interpolation-free mesh adaptation and compressible flow simulations for aeroelastic applications
Study of transonic flutter phenomena with unsteady mesh adaptation through the Mmg library coupled in a Fortran 2003 code for the interpolation-free compressible flow simulations over adaptive meshes.

Detailed descriptions can be found in my Ph.D. thesis and some publications:
- [Conservative interpolation-free mesh adaptation for three-dimensional aeroelastic simulations in unsteady compressible flows](https://www.politesi.polimi.it/handle/10589/142548){:target="_blank"}
- [Numerical simulation of nonclassical aileron buzz over 3D unstructured adaptive meshes](https://re.public.polimi.it/retrieve/handle/11311/1057445/295441/CIRRL01-18.pdf){:target="_blank"}

## Generalized beam models for aeroelastic morphing analysis
Analysis and development of a reduced-order structural model for morphing aeroelastic applications.

Detailed descriptions can be found (again) in my Ph.D. thesis and some publications:
- [Conservative interpolation-free mesh adaptation for three-dimensional aeroelastic simulations in unsteady compressible flows](https://www.politesi.polimi.it/handle/10589/142548){:target="_blank"}
- [Generalized beam models analysis for aeroelastic morphing applications](https://re.public.polimi.it/retrieve/handle/11311/1057446/295443/CIRRL02-18.pdf){:target="_blank"}
