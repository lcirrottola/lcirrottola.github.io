# Current
## Development of the parallel mesh adaptation library [ParMmg](https://github.com/MmgTools/ParMmg)
Open source library for parallel mesh adaptation on top of the [Mmg3d](https://github.com/MmgTools/Mmg) remesher.

Written in C with MPI, version-controlled with git and tested with jenkins. Designed to meet the academic and industrial needs of the [Mmg platform](https://www.mmgtools.org) and the [ExaQUte](http://exaqute.eu) European project.
