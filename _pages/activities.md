# Current projects
## Development of the parallel mesh adaptation library [ParMmg](https://github.com/MmgTools/ParMmg){:target="_blank"}
Open source library for parallel mesh adaptation on top of the [Mmg3d](https://github.com/MmgTools/Mmg){:target="_blank"} remesher.

Written in C with MPI, version-controlled with git and tested with Jenkins. Designed to meet the academic and industrial needs of the [Mmg platform](https://www.mmgtools.org){:target="_blank"} and the [ExaQUte](http://exaqute.eu){:target="_blank"} European research project.

Details on the algorithm can be found in the document:
- [Parallel unstructured mesh adaptation using iterative remeshing and repartitioning](https://hal.inria.fr/hal-02386837/document){:target="_blank"}

## Development of the constant-connectivity mesh adaptation library _Fmg_
Library to perform constant-connectivity mesh adaptation in two and three dimensions for fluid mechanics simulations with moving fronts (like shock waves, free surface waves) for research applications.
